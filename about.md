# Schooling the (Boston) Public: Continuity and Change in Boston Public Schools, 1874-2020
I am working towards a certificate in Digital Humanities as part of my coursework as a History PhD student at Northeastern University, and this project will serve as the centerpiece of my DH work.  I am interested in two particular facets of the history of Boston Public Schools (BPS): the changing demographics within and among schools (particularly from the 1970s, after court-ordered desegregation began in the district, to the present), and the ethnographic disconnect between school communities and the names of the schools that commemorate (mostly male, mostly white) figures from Boston’s past.  
In my research, I am taking a long look back at the schoolhouses built by the city of Boston, and trying to find out why and by whom the buildings were dedicated and named the way they were.  I am also looking at years of demographic data reported to the state of Massachusetts by BPS and mapping demographic shifts over time.  I am working on both of these ‘buckets’ of research simultaneously, because I ultimately want to tell a broad story about how BPS has developed into the district it is today – and show how past events continue to shape our systems and the students who are part of them.
